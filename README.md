**Overview:**

This project explores the classification of wine varieties using multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the most accurate model. The goal is to compare various classifiers based on their confusion metrics and select the best one for this task. The project leverages the well-known Wine Dataset, which includes chemical properties of different wine samples.

**Classifiers Implimentation:**

*Random Forest

*Logistic Regression

*Support Vector Machine (SVM)

*Gradient Boosting
